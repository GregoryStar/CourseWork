This folder contains all five homework assignments (plus homework 0, which was mandatory but not graded) we were required to do in 
the Fall 2018 semester of Machine Learning.

The data sets were provided to us, but all included MATLAB code was written by me except for main.m in Homework 4; we were asked to
modify this file, but the bulk of it was not written by me.

I've included the data sets my code is meant to run on, but please note that this data does not belong to me: this data is public and
free to use.

*NOTE: To run the scripts, all files in the "scripts", and "data" folders must be brought together. I've separated them to make the
repo cleaner, but due to the way the assignment instructions were written, the scripts require the data to be in the same folder as
them.*
