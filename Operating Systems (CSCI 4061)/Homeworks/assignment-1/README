The purpose of this program is to tally the votes of various districts (stored
in files), and declare the winner of an election, which is output to a file.

Compile the program by running "make" in the terminal.

run "./votecounter.o input.txt" in the terminal
(input.txt should be in current working directory)

- Parses input from 'input.txt' line by line
- Constructs a tree of the regions as an array of nodes
- Creates a process hierarchy which matches the tree structure
- Executes 'leafcounter' on the leaf nodes of the tree
- The results are output to files which are used as inputs for the next step
- Processes which are not leafs must wait for their children to finish.
- Executes 'aggregate_votes' on output files created by children of node for
  nodes that are parents, but not the root node.
- Executes 'Who_Won' on head node.
Various checks are done to ensure the input is valid along the way. Among which
is a check for cycles. If a cycle is found, the program halts execution.

Wrote most logic for parsing lines. Created tree of nodes from parsed input.
Created process hierarchy. Called exec on all processes. Wrote cycle finder.

Assisted in writing C code from logic.
Fixed MAJOR errors and bugs.
Tested for edge cases.
Parse input to ignore comments and empty lines.
Created makefile.
