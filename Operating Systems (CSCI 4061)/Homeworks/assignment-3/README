The purpose of this program is to tally the votes (stored in files) of various
districts and declare the winner of an election. The districts, and their relationships, 
are stored in an input file. Based on the input file a directory structure is 
created and the files in the input directory are decrypted and stored.
Once the winner is determined, it is output to a file in the root of an output directory. 
Threads are called to aggregate and propagate results of each leaf file up the directory.
In the end, all threads synchonize, and a final result is reached.
