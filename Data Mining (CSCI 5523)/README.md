This folder contains all three programming assignments we were required to do in the Fall 2018 semester of Data Mining.

The data sets were provided to us, but all included Java and Python code was written by me unless explicitly mentioned
in the comments of the code. All of my code runs reasonably fast (in the upper 10% of the class), but is not nearly
fast enough for use in research/industry; the professor's code runs orders of magnitude faster. However, this code could
certainly be used to make inferences about smaller data sets, and it's easier to use/understand than some more serious
implementations.

I've included the data sets my code is meant to run on, but please note that this data does not belong to me: this data
is public and free to use.
